# traffic-counts

Documentation, for both the library and the [import program](src/bin/import.rs) is generated by [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html) from comments. Until it is deployed elsewhere, view it by cloning this repository and run `cargo doc --no-deps --open`.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables should be included in a .env file:

```.env
DATA_DIR="data"
DB_USERNAME=DVRPCTC_TEST 
DB_PASSWORD='password here'
```

## Tests

NOTE: the tests in the `db` module require database access, which is limited to white-listed IPs. Therefore, tests are ignored by default. To include them in the test suite, use `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.
